# The Politics of AI Ethics
This repository includes the code for my Master's dissertation at University College London.

My project analyses the effects of industry collaboration and sponsorship on AI ethics research.  Using bibliographic data, I contrast research topics, study designs, and conclusions put forth by industry and non-industry affiliated researchers.

Files in this repository include:

* **author_search.ipynb**: Script to retrieve the Scopus Author Identifier for each author in bibliographic dataset; Jupyter Notebook
* **article_classification.ipynb**: Script to process bibliographic dataset and classify articles as industry and non-industry affiliated; Jupyter notebook
* **The Politics of AI Ethics_Thematic Analysis.xlsx**: 
* **VOSviewer**: The map and network files required to re-create the term maps in VOSviewer
