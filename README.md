# The Politics of AI Ethics
This repository includes the code for my Master's dissertation at University College London.

My project analyses the effects of industry collaboration and sponsorship on AI ethics research.  Using bibliographic data and research articles, I contrast research topics, study designs, and conclusions put forth by industry and non-industry affiliated researchers.  The code in this repository categorises research publications as either industry affiliated or not, depending on author affiliations and funding acknowledgements.
