# The politics of responsibility: Does industry affect AI ethics research?

Corporations that profit from the design and use of AI technology increasingly contribute to scholarly understanding of its social and ethical implications – a field known as “AI ethics”.  Motivated by evidence that industry has influenced research on tobacco, climate science, and pharmaceuticals according to its commercial priorities, it is crucial to determine whether a similar phenomenon exists in AI ethics.  In this study, I create a novel corpus of AI ethics publications segmented by those that are, and those that are not, affiliated with industry and employ a mixed methods approach comprising co-word and thematic analysis. I show that both industry and non-industry affiliated researchers conceive the issues pertinent to AI ethics as fundamentally technical.  Further, industry authors rely on computational study designs and restrict participation to industry practitioners or those with technical expertise.  From these findings, I draw three insights: i) the overall field of AI ethics perpetuates the notion that ethical issues are somehow independent of organisational practices and priorities, ii) industry research attempts to position the private sector as the sole agent of enacting ethical change, and iii) the field of AI ethics can only address problems and solutions that fit within its technical frame.  I conclude by showing that this framing is only one of many potential lenses for a study of the social and ethical implications of AI technology.
